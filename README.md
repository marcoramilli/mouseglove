### Original WebSite

[Moue Glove WebSite](http://mouseglove.sourceforge.net/)

### Quick Description
MouseGlove is an open source project for a new generation of mouse. The goal of this project is to provide an open source hardware and software stimulating new developers to improve the usability of computers through new interfaces. MouseGlove is a new kind of interface born for helping people affected by disabilities who cannot use common interfaces such as mouse and keyboard. MouseGlobe offers a natural way to move the screen pointer, click and drag objects. Each action is natural as using your hands to keep, move and touch real objects on a desktop. I encourage every developer to grab my source code and electronics and build an improved version of MouseGlove, keeping alive the next generation of computer mouse interfaces. In this website I'll publish all the future projects, so please if you improved MouseGlove send me an eMail with pictures, codes and details I'll add your MouseGlove version on this web site. 

The following images show the first Alpha version of MouseGlove. To see the details, to download the code and electronics and to see some screenshots use the left Menu.

MouseGlobe uses an ARDUINO duemilanove board (ATMEGA 328) to control two main signals, Left and Right Clicks, an accelerometer to capture the hand movements, and finally a glove to fit the sensors to the hand. A Java based ''Driver'' captures the hardware signals translating them into cursor movements.
